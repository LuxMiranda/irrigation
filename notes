Okay, so we need to create a turtle-info-set. It'll be called like this:

get-max-one-of (turtle-info-set) <mutated factor>


Turtle infos will need to be replicated 11 times for each of the 11 possible investment numbers

e.g.

my-contribution                        : 0
last-upstream-neighbor-contibution     : 2
last-downstream-neighbor-contribution  : 1

my-contribution                        : 1
last-upstream-neighbor-contibution     : 2
last-downstream-neighbor-contribution  : 1

my-contribution                        : 2
last-upstream-neighbor-contibution     : 2
last-downstream-neighbor-contribution  : 1

etc

Factor will take in a turtle-info, calculate the [0,1] number based on it.

It's kind of janky... But it'll work. 


OR


Could we run by a turtle???

Then each factor takes in the turtle plus just the standard range... might be easier
