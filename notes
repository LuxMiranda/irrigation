TODO:
  Make sure that calibration parameters (like trust, impact, etc.) are being set ALWAYS and not just when the model type is selected
  Should different probabilizations have different obtusenesses?


Things to update documentation with:
  Additional parameter in EMD intialization
  Fix the setObjectiveFunction line with the right function name
  Also its set_objective_function now
